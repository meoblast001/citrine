### Citrine - Legacy C++ Game Engine

Citrine is a game engine I worked on in 2010. It served its purpose in helping
me learn a lot about game development and C++. I used it to make some cool
mini-games too! Sadly, it never saw productive use. No problem though! Now I'm
uploading it to GitHub so that it can serve as a learning tool for others. I
can't guarantee that it works in its current state though, or even builds,
because I haven't used it in quite a while. Feel free to patch anything you
find, and hey, maybe even submit a PR. Maybe Citrine could even become what it
was intended to become.
